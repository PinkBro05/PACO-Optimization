###Test 22: Dense Network (5 nodes)
#Description: A small fully-connected network with varied weights. Tests algorithms in a high branching situation where many direct and indirect routes exist (Dijkstra/A* must choose the lowest-cost combination among all possible).
#Optimal Path: 1 → 3 → 4 (Total cost: 6)
