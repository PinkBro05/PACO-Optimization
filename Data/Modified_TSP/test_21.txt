###Test 21: Free vs Toll Path (4 nodes)
#Description: One path has zero-cost edges but more steps, the other is a direct toll. Tests algorithms in presence of zero-cost edges (BFS might choose the 1-step toll route of cost6 over the 2-step free+cheap route of cost5).
#Optimal Path: 1 → 2 → 3 (Total cost: 5)
