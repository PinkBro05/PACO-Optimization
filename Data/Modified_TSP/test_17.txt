###Test 17: Nearest vs Cheapest Goal (4 nodes)
#Description: Physically closest goal has a very high cost edge; a farther goal is cheaper via multiple steps. Tests choosing the truly lowest-cost goal over the nearest one (Greedy may go to 2 because it’s closer, but 3 via 4 is cheaper).
#Optimal Path: 1 → 4 → 3 (Total cost: 2)
