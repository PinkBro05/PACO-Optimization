###Test 26: Labyrinth of Traps (11 nodes)
#Description: A full gauntlet combining multiple traps: a dead-end branch (1-2-3-8), a cycle (2-7-3), a heavy misleading shortcut (2-6), and two goal options. Only destination 9 offers a lower-cost path; destination 8 is closer but more expensive. Tests all algorithms comprehensively: BFS/DFS may find the nearer goal 8 first (trap), Greedy is drawn to 8’s proximity, ACO might initially follow the short path, but the optimal route goes through 4-5-6 to goal 9.
#Optimal Path: 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 9 (Total cost: 4)
