###Test 25: Complex Weighted Network (7 nodes)
#Description: Highly connected weighted graph with many possible routes. Tests global optimality: the algorithm must combine edges to find the minimum-cost path among a tangle of options (Greedy might get lured by locally cheap edges that lead to a costlier overall route).
#Optimal Path: 1 → 3 → 4 (Total cost: 6)
