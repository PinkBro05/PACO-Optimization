###Test 15: ACO Pheromone Trap (9 nodes)
#Description: Shorter path with higher cost vs longer path with lower cost. Tests ACO behavior (initially more ants find the short expensive path, but the long cheap path has lower total cost). Also challenges Greedy (which favors the nearer path).
#Optimal Path: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 (Total cost: 5)
