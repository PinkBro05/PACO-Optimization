###Test 18: Local Optima (9 nodes)
#Description: Two nearly equal routes to the goal (cost differs by 1). Tests ACO’s potential to get stuck in a local optimum (initial random choice might favor the slightly worse path). Also checks tie-breaking in deterministic algorithms.
#Optimal Path: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (Total cost: 8)
